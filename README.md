#Pong Game in Python using Pygame

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game created in Python using the Pygame library.
Game Description

Pong is a two-player sports game that simulates table tennis. Players control paddles and try to hit the ball past their opponent. The first player to reach a certain score wins the game.

#How to Play

    Use the up and down arrow keys to control the paddle on the right-hand side.
    The game starts automatically. The ball moves at a constant speed and changes direction when it collides with paddles or walls.
    Score points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.
    The game ends when one player reaches the maximum score limit (currently set to 10).
    The winner will be displayed on the screen.
